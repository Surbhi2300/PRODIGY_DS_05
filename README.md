**Traffic Accident Analysis Based on Road Conditions, Weather, and Time**

This project analyzes a US traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns related to the time of day, weather conditions, and accident locations. Using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and folium, it visualizes accident trends by hour, weather type, and day vs. night, and creates an interactive heatmap to highlight accident hotspots across the country. These insights help understand factors contributing to accidents and can support safety improvements.
